# Alfa — maintainer guide for coding agents

Alfa is a valuation screen for blockchains: it measures the gap between what
a chain earns and what it costs, ranks 85 chains by it, and surrounds the
ranking with market context. Next.js 15 (App Router), tRPC 11, TanStack Query 5,
Tailwind v4, zustand, TypeScript strict. This file is the operating manual; the
README explains the product and the model to humans.

## Commands

| Task                                                         | Command                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dev server (always port 3001; 3000 is taken on this machine) | `pnpm dev`                                                              |
| Type check / lint / production build                         | `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`                             |
| Format (write / check)                                       | `pnpm format:write`, `pnpm format:check`                                |
| Dead code, unused deps and exports                           | `pnpm knip` (config in `knip.json`; mark intentional exports `@public`) |

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `format:check`, `typecheck`, `lint` and
`knip` on every push to `main` and every pull request; run the same four
locally before committing. Deploys are Vercel's Git integration, not CI.

Gotchas: `pnpm build` writes to `.next` while `next dev` serves from it, so
never build while a browser check is running, and restart the dev server after
a build. Editing any server module re-instantiates it and empties the
in-process cache tier, so the first request after an edit is a cold fetch
(Redis, if configured, usually answers within seconds). Prettier re-wraps
lines: when patching files programmatically, anchor on whitespace-tolerant
patterns, and re-read a file after formatting before patching it again.

## Layout

```
src/app/                 routes; page.tsx prefetches chains + market.brief; api/health warms caches
src/server/domain/       score.ts (the model), aggregate.ts (snapshot build, universe, flow union),
                         market*.ts (display-only market indicators), types.ts
src/server/sources/      one adapter per upstream: defillama, artemis, mayan, coingecko, coinmetrics,
                         alternative-me, mempool, l2beat, news (Google News RSS), bridges/{wormhole,debridge}
src/server/cache/        cachedValue(key, {ttlSeconds, staleSeconds}, loader): L1 map + Upstash Redis,
                         stale-while-revalidate, refreshes kept alive with waitUntil
src/server/api/routers/  chains (list, detail, meta, news, methodology, compare), market (brief, cycle, detail)
src/components/          screen.tsx (home), division-leaders.tsx (the L1/L2 hero),
                         chain-detail.tsx, compare-window.tsx, table/, chart/,
                         market/, window/, ui/
src/lib/                 palette (tiers, rainbow, zone strokes), glossary, format, cycle-models, market-zones
src/stores/              zustand filters store (persisted; version-bump + migrate on shape changes)
```

## Rules that must hold

1. **The market layer is display-only.** `score.ts` and `aggregate.ts` import
   nothing from `market*`. Fear & Greed, altcoin season, rainbow, cycles and
   flows are shown, never scored. Check with
   `grep -n "market-" src/server/domain/score.ts src/server/domain/aggregate.ts`.
2. **Every source is free and keyless.** No paid tiers, no API keys beyond the
   optional Upstash Redis. DefiLlama's bridges API, CoinGecko history beyond
   365 days and total-market-cap history are paid; do not reintroduce them.
3. **Every source is optional.** A failed or slow upstream yields `null` and a
   `degraded`/`unavailable` status, never a thrown page. Sources carry
   deadlines (`deadline()` in `server/lib/http.ts`) so an SSR prefetch never
   waits on a cold 4.6 MB fetch; the underlying fetch keeps running into the
   cache.
4. **Labels are honest.** Say what a number is and is not: 90-day window, price
   × today's supply, top-100 not total market, "peer-implied, not a price",
   which bridges a total covers. When a source overlaps another, remove the
   overlap explicitly (Mayan's Wormhole-tagged share, Artemis' own Wormhole and
   deBridge attribution) rather than summing or excluding wholesale.
5. **No brand words in product copy.** Terminology is generic finance: value
   gap, undervalued / overvalued, fairly valued, fair value. "Par" survives only
   in internal identifiers (`par.*` localStorage keys, cache prefix `par:v1`,
   `ParScale`), which are kept so saved state survives; do not migrate them
   without being asked.
6. **Dataviz discipline.** One y-axis per chart (aligned strips with a shared
   crosshair, or colour, never dual axes). Diverging blue = cheap/undervalued,
   red = expensive/overvalued, reserved for that meaning. Categorical trio for
   identity only — and note `--color-series-1` _is_ `--color-under`, so pairing
   it with series-2's warm orange reads as a value judgement; the compare window
   uses series-1 and series-3 for that reason. Status colours only with a glyph or label. Every colour
   encoding has a named legend. The rainbow chart is the one deliberate
   multi-hue ramp, and every band is named twice.
7. **Windows are outside `HydrateClient`.** A `useQuery` there for a key the
   page prefetched makes TanStack defer hydration and causes an SSR mismatch.
   Windows read prefetched data through their own queries only when those keys
   are never prefetched (market.cycle, market.detail, chains.compare) or via
   the detail payload.
8. **`score.ts` and `thesis.ts` must stay pure.** The home screen imports both
   into the browser to re-score the universe on fully diluted valuation
   (`lib/rebase-universe.ts`), so neither may import `server-only`, the cache,
   an adapter, or anything else with a runtime dependency — types only. This is
   what guarantees the two bases are the same model rather than two
   implementations: measured 12 September 2026, the client recompute reproduces
   the server's scores to 3.9e-14 with identical tiers and multiples. Check with
   `grep -n "^import" src/server/domain/score.ts src/server/domain/thesis.ts`.
9. **"Fully diluted" means one thing.** `dilutedCapOf` in
   `lib/valuation-basis.ts` is the single definition — price × maximum supply
   where a chain has one, CoinGecko's total-supply `fdv` only where it does not
   — and both the basis toggle and the Compare window go through it. Do not
   read `metrics.fdv` directly for anything labelled "fully diluted".
10. **Config changes that change data shape bump a cache key** (the snapshot key
   carries the universe cap) and, for the persisted store, the version with a
   `migrate`.

## Data facts worth not rediscovering

- DefiLlama coins `/chart` caps at 500 points per request: daily for ~15 months,
  weekly (`period=1w`) since late 2017, spliced onto one daily grid.
- CoinMetrics community API returns full BTC history since 2010 in one request
  (nanosecond timestamps; parse the date part). Projected to ~150 KB before
  caching.
- alternative.me `limit=0` returns all of Fear & Greed since 2018-02-01; the
  feed skips days, so align by date and forward-fill.
- Mayan `chains-overview?timeRange=30d` is honoured; any other parameter name
  silently returns lifetime volume. The adapter throws if a month exceeds half
  of all-time.
- Artemis flows: 43 chains; named bridges are Across, deBridge, USDT0,
  Wormhole; the rest is canonical/unnamed pair flow. It does not carry Mayan.
- Universe: DefiLlama chains with ≥ $3M TVL or Artemis-tracked, top 85 by TVL.
  Ranks 56–85 are as well covered as the top 55; coverage breaks below ~$8M TVL.
- Vercel Hobby: crons once per day at most (more frequent schedules fail the
  deploy), functions up to 300 s, `waitUntil` work counts toward it.
- CoinGecko `/coins/markets` carries supply, the all-time high and its date in
  the same response the app already fetches, so those cost no extra request. Its
  `fully_diluted_valuation` is price × **total** supply, not max supply (measured
  6 September 2026: Bitcoin implies 20.08M against a 21M max). Anything labelled
  "fully diluted" must therefore say total supply.
- Token unlocks: DefiLlama's emissions **API** answers HTTP 402
  (`api.llama.fi/emissions`, `/emission/{p}`, `/emissionsBreakdown`), but the
  static dataset CDN `defillama-datasets.llama.fi/emissions/{slug}` is open and
  keyless. 40 of 85 chains have a document; 0.19–5.9 MB each (Celo the
  largest, its schedule running to 2050) and 69 MB in
  total, so it is fetched one chain at a time from `chains.tokenomics` and must
  never touch the snapshot. Nine slugs need aliases (the token is filed under
  the bridge, foundation or flagship DEX). Four document shapes exist: two are
  stubs, and a third omits `supplyMetrics` while carrying real tranches
  (Starknet, Sui, Ronin), so the denominator falls back to CoinGecko's max
  supply — validation is structural, not by field name.
- DefiLlama's `tokenAllocation.current`/`.final` percentages are **renormalised
  over only the classified tranches**, so every bucket overstates: Arbitrum
  insiders read 39.4% against 26.9% of max supply, Hyperliquid's airdrop 79.9%
  against 31.0%. Always recompute from the per-tranche series with an explicit
  remainder. `categories` keys differ from the series labels by case and carry
  a `" (TBD)"` suffix; the series are cumulative but **not monotonic**
  (Ethereum's staking tranche falls, netting EIP-1559 burns).
- News: Google News RSS gives a title and nothing else — no body, no image, and
  its links are redirects. There is no keyless sentiment API either (CryptoPanic
  403s without a key, its v2 endpoint 404s; CoinGecko news is Pro-only), so
  `domain/news-classify.ts` is a local pattern match on the headline. It names
  the **event**, never a bullish/bearish direction: the direction version was
  measured at ~57% on bearish calls, and its failures ("no user funds lost" read
  as bullish) were confident. Keep every pattern word-bounded, never flip on
  negation — refuse instead — and leave anything with a contrast word unlabelled.
  About 24% of headlines get a badge; positives outrun negatives 2:1 because the
  press does.
- A Google News search for a chain mostly returns other people's news when the
  chain is named after an English word: of 1,989 headline-chain pairs, 488 never
  named the chain (Abstract 45/46, BOB 30/39, Provenance 17/19). `news.ts` keeps
  only titles that name the chain via `NEWS_ALIASES`; ten chains legitimately go
  to zero. Match on word boundaries — `near` otherwise hits "climbs near $65,000"
  and `ton` hits "Washington".
- Social metrics: X's API is paid, `syndication.twitter.com` answers 429 on the
  first request, CoinGecko's free `community_data` is null and keyless GitHub
  allows 60 requests an hour. CoinPaprika `/v1/coins/{id}` carries follower,
  subscriber and repository counts keylessly at 20,000 requests a month.

## Verification

Every change is verified in a real browser before it is reported, at desktop
width and at a phone width (390×844, `isMobile`): run the dev server on 3001,
drive it with Playwright (MCP `browser_run_code_unsafe`),
measure rather than eyeball (bounding boxes for overlaps and alignment, DOM
counts, console errors must be zero), take a capture and look at it. Probe API
payloads with curl against `/api/trpc/<router>.<proc>`. Then `pnpm build`,
restart the dev server, and warm `/api/trpc/chains.meta` and
`/api/trpc/market.brief`.

## Conventions

- Conventional commits (`feat(scope):`, `fix:`, `perf(cache):`, `docs:`), body
  explaining why, co-author trailer when an agent authored it.
- Docblocks explain decisions and the evidence for them, including what was
  tried and removed. Keep them current when the decision changes.
- Names rejected for this app: Assay, ChainFather, Par, Fathom, Caliper, Cipher.
  It is Alfa — alpha, the excess return over a benchmark, which is the gap this
  screen measures and what the alpha map plots.
