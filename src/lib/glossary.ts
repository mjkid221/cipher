    title: "Value gap",
    short:
      "How far the market's price sits from what the chain's actual activity supports, on a scale of −100 to +100.",
    long: "Positive means the chain is undervalued against its peers: it earns, holds or moves more than its market cap suggests. Negative means the opposite. Zero means price and activity are in line with the rest of the screen.\n\nIt is a relative measure. A chain scoring +40 is cheap compared with the other chains listed here, not cheap in absolute terms.",
    formula:
      "43% the gap between its fundamentals rank and its market-cap rank, 32% how cheap its valuation ratios are, 25% whether its activity is growing.",

  fundamentals: {
    title: "Fundamentals",
    short:
      "How big the chain's real economy is, scored 0 to 100 against the other chains on this screen.",

Both are trivially inflated by airdrop farming and bot traffic, and neither says much about whether a chain earns anything.",
    formula:
      "Weighted average of percentile ranks. Fees carry the most weight at 20%, then stablecoin float at 18%.",

      "Whether that economy is growing or shrinking, scored 0 to 100 against peers.",
    long: "Compares the last 30 days with the 30 before them across fees, stablecoin float, capital, DEX volume, bridged volume and real-world assets.\n\nMomentum carries a quarter of the value gap on purpose. A cheap valuation on a shrinking business is a value trap, not an opportunity, and without this term the model would rank decaying chains highest.",
    formula:
      "Weighted average of percentile-ranked 30-day growth rates. Fee growth carries the most weight at 27%, then stablecoin growth at 22%.",
    example: "A score of 20 means almost every other chain is growing faster.",
  },

  cheapness: {
    title: "Cheapness",
    short:
      "How low the chain's valuation ratios are compared with peers. Higher means cheaper.",
    long: "Six ratios of market cap to something real: annualised fees, TVL, annualised revenue, stablecoin float, annualised DEX volume, and real-world assets. Each is ranked and then inverted, so the chain with the lowest ratio scores highest.\n\nA chain needs at least two of the six to be scored at all. One odd denominator is enough to put a chain wrongly at the top of a cheapest-first list.",
    formula:
      "Weighted average of inverted percentile ranks across the six ratios.",

      "A score of 91 means only 9% of chains trade on cheaper multiples.",

    title: "Confidence",
    short:
      "How much the score can be trusted, based on how complete the chain's data is and how big the chain is.",
    long: "Two things drag a score toward guesswork. Missing inputs, and size. A chain with a $3M TVL can post a spectacular valuation ratio purely because its denominator is close to noise.\n\nThis is not a percentile. It does not say the chain is better or worse than its peers, only how much weight to put on its position.",
    formula:
      "55% the share of model inputs the chain actually supplied, plus 45% a size gate that ramps from $5M to $5B on the larger of TVL, stablecoins, or 20× annualised fees.",
    example:
      "Below 45%, the model stops using the chain to fit the peer trend line and flags it as directional only.",

  percentile: {
    title: "Percentile",
    short:
      "A chain's rank on one measure against every other chain on this screen, from 0 to 100.",
    long: "Percentiles are used throughout instead of raw values because crypto metrics span enormous ranges. Ethereum's fees are thousands of times a small chain's, and any straight average would be decided entirely by the largest number in it.\n\nThe comparison set is the chains listed here, currently capped at the 55 largest by TVL. It is not a ranking against all blockchains that exist.",
    example: "82 means the chain beats 82% of the screen on that measure.",

  peerFit: {
    title: "How much fundamentals explain",
    short:
      "The share of the differences in chain market caps that economic scale accounts for.",
    long: "Market caps are plotted against a measure of each chain's economic size, and a line is fitted through them. This number is how much of the spread that line captures. Statisticians call it R-squared, on a scale of 0 to 1.\n\nAround half is the interesting result. If fundamentals explained nearly everything, there would be no mispricing to find and no reason for this screen. If they explained almost nothing, the model would have no basis at all. Half means the numbers matter and leave real room for the market to be wrong.",
    formula: "R², the coefficient of determination from the peer regression.",
    example:
      "0.52 means about half the variation in market caps tracks economic scale, and half is narrative, token age, float and everything else.",

  trendBand: {
    title: "The shaded band",
    short:
      "The range around the trend line where roughly two chains in three sit.",
    long: "Chains scatter around the peer trend line rather than sitting on it. The band shows one standard deviation of that scatter, written σ in statistics, which by convention covers about 68% of cases.\n\nThe band here is wide, several times over in either direction. That is the honest picture and it is why this app reports a chain's distance from the line rather than converting it into a price target it cannot support.",
    example:
      "A chain outside the band is unusually priced for its size, in whichever direction it sits.",
  },

  trendResidual: {
    title: "Distance from trend",
    short:
      "How far a chain's market cap sits from the peer trend line, measured in standard deviations.",
    long: "Negative means the market values the chain below what its economic size would predict; positive means above. The unit is the σ from the shaded band, so −1.0 sits exactly one band-width below the line.\n\nIt is deliberately reported this way rather than as a percentage upside. With a fit this loose, a percentage would imply a precision the data does not have.",
    example:
      "−1.4 means priced well below trend, in the bottom seventh or so of the scatter.",
  },

  scaleIndex: {
    title: "Economic scale index",
    short:
      "A single 0 to 100 measure of how economically large a chain is, on a log scale.",
    long: "The horizontal axis of the alpha map. It blends fees, TVL, stablecoins, DEX volume, revenue, real-world assets, bridged volume and protocols, all in log space so the distances between chains stay meaningful.\n\nThis is a separate calculation from the fundamentals score. Fundamentals uses percentile ranks, which are robust but flatten the gaps between chains. The trend line needs those gaps preserved, so it uses this instead.",
  },

  valueTrap: {
    title: "Value-trap risk",
    short:
      "The chain looks cheap on its ratios, but the activity underneath it is shrinking.",
    long: "Flagged when a chain is meaningfully undervalued while momentum sits in the bottom third. These are the chains that look most attractive on a screen and most often should not be bought, because the denominator of every cheap-looking ratio is still falling.",
  },

  rwa: {
    title: "Real-world assets",
    short:
      "Tokenised off-chain assets held on the chain: treasuries, private credit, tokenised equities and funds.",
    long: "Counted across every protocol DefiLlama categorises as RWA or RWA Lending, summed by chain. It is a measure of institutional capital that has chosen to settle somewhere, and it tends to be far stickier than yield-chasing TVL.\n\nA chain with no entry genuinely holds none, so it ranks last rather than going unscored.",
    example: "Ethereum holds roughly $15B, Stellar and Solana around $2B each.",
  },

  bridgeVolume: {
    title: "Bridge volume",
    short:
      "Value moved to and from the chain through cross-chain bridge aggregators over 30 days.",
    long: "Covers the 27 aggregator front-ends DefiLlama tracks, including LI.FI, Jumper, Socket and Rango. Rising bridged volume means capital is choosing to move somewhere, which tends to lead TVL, which in turn tends to lead price.\n\nDefiLlama's full bridge deposit and withdrawal data moved behind a paid plan, so this measures aggregator-routed flow rather than every bridge transfer.",
  },

  stablecoins: {
    title: "Stablecoin float",
    short: "Dollars parked on the chain as stablecoins.",
    long: "The least gameable measure of whether anyone is actually using a chain. Stablecoin supply is money someone chose to settle somewhere, rather than incentivised deposits chasing a yield that will leave when the yield does.\n\nBoth the level and its 30-day direction are scored, at 18% of fundamentals and 22% of momentum — the heaviest weights in the model after fees.",
  },

  dexVolume: {
    title: "DEX volume",
    short:
      "Spot trading volume on decentralised exchanges on the chain, over 30 days.",
    long: "A throughput measure rather than a capital one. It captures how hard the capital sitting on a chain is actually working, and it is the same figure DefiLlama reports on its DEX rankings.",
  },

  chainFees: {
    title: "Chain fees",
    short:
      "Fees earned by the chain itself, not by the applications running on it.",
    long: "This distinction changes the answer completely. Summing every protocol on Ethereum gives roughly $288M over 30 days; the network itself earns around $10M of that. The rest accrues to Uniswap, Aave and the other applications, not to ETH.\n\nFor valuing a chain's token, the network's own take is the correct denominator. It also makes most layer ones look expensive on a price-to-fees basis, which is a real finding rather than an error.",
  },

  mcapToFees: {
    title: "Market cap ÷ annualised fees",
    short:
      "What the market pays for each dollar of fee income the chain itself earns each year.",
    long: "The closest crypto equivalent to a price-to-sales ratio. Lower is cheaper. Because chain-level fees are small relative to token valuations, these multiples run into the hundreds or thousands, and the peer median is the number worth comparing against rather than any absolute threshold.",
  },

  netFlow: {
    title: "Net cross-chain flow",
    short:
      "Capital that moved onto a chain minus capital that left it, over the last 30 days.",
    long: "Positive means more value arrived than departed. It is the clearest read on where capital is choosing to sit, and it tends to move before the metrics the model scores: money bridges in, then TVL rises, then price follows.\n\nCombined from four public sources — Artemis (Across, USDT0 and the canonical bridges), Mayan, Wormhole and deBridge — with each dollar counted once, across roughly fifty chains. It is shown rather than scored, because that is still not every chain on this screen and scoring a metric some cannot have would penalise them for it.",
    example:
      "A chain gaining capital is not automatically undervalued. Read it as a reason to look, not a conclusion.",
  },

  dilution: {
    title: "Dilution overhang",
    short:
      "Fully diluted valuation divided by circulating market cap. How much of the token supply is still to come.",
    long: "Every valuation ratio on this screen divides *circulating* market cap, because that is what you can buy today. That quietly flatters any chain with a large unlock ahead: the fees look cheap against today's float and considerably less cheap against tomorrow's.\n\n1.0 means the supply is fully issued. 4.3 means four times the current float is still to be released. It is shown rather than scored, but it is the first thing to check on anything this screen calls cheap.",
    example:
      "Bitcoin sits near 1.0. Hyperliquid is above 4, so its circulating cap describes a fraction of the eventual supply.",
  },

  unlockSchedule: {
    title: "Still to unlock",
    short:
      "The share of the token's maximum supply that has not yet been released, and when the published schedule releases it.",
    long: "Dilution overhang says how much supply is still to come. This says when, and to whom. It is read from DefiLlama's published emission schedules, which name each allocation — team, investors, public sale, treasury — and the dates it vests on.\n\nEvery percentage divides the schedule's own **maximum** supply, not the tokens in circulation. Those two numbers disagree, sometimes by a factor of four: a treasury allocation that has unlocked counts as unlocked here while nobody has sold it, so it is not in circulation. Both figures are shown side by side rather than reconciled, because neither is wrong.\n\nAvailable for 40 of the 85 chains listed. A chain with no published schedule shows nothing rather than a guess, and none of this feeds the score.",
    formula:
      "(maximum supply − tokens unlocked to date) ÷ maximum supply. Unlocked to date is the sum of every allocation's released amount on today's date.",
    example:
      "Monad has 49.9% of its maximum supply still to unlock, with a single 17.1B token release dated 24 November 2026.",
  },

  tokenAllocation: {
    title: "Who the supply went to",
    short:
      "How the token's maximum supply is divided between insiders, private-sale investors, the public and the treasury.",
    long: "Two bars: what has unlocked so far, and what the published schedule ends at. Both are shares of maximum supply, so they are directly comparable — a bucket that grows between them is one whose tokens are still arriving.\n\nThese percentages are **recomputed** from the individual allocations rather than taken from DefiLlama's own summary, which divides each bucket by only the allocations it managed to classify and so overstates every one of them. Measured September 2026, its summary puts Arbitrum's insiders at 39.4% where the team allocation is 26.9% of maximum supply. Whatever the schedule does not account for is shown as its own segment instead of being divided away.\n\nThe categories are DefiLlama's. An allocation it could not place sits in \"Other\" rather than being assigned a bucket by guesswork.",
    example:
      "Monad's insiders hold none of the supply unlocked today and 30.5% of the eventual supply, because the team and treasury allocations had not started vesting.",
  },

  vestingProgress: {
    title: "Unlock curve",
    short:
      "Cumulative tokens released over the life of the published schedule, against the maximum supply.",
    long: "The filled area is what has been released; the space above it is what the schedule has yet to release. A step is a cliff — a single dated release. A slope is linear vesting, paid out continuously.\n\nIt is not guaranteed to rise. Ethereum's line falls in places, because its staking issuance nets off the fees burned under EIP-1559, and that is the source recording a genuine contraction rather than an error to smooth over.",
    formula:
      "Every allocation's released amount summed at each date, sampled weekly or wider so the whole schedule fits in one view.",
  },

  unlockCliff: {
    title: "Cliff and linear vesting",
    short:
      "A cliff releases a whole allocation on one date. Linear vesting releases it gradually.",
    long: "The distinction matters for what to expect. A cliff is a dated event with a known size, and the supply arrives at once. Linear vesting spreads the same tokens across months or years, so it never produces a single day of pressure.\n\nThe table of upcoming releases lists cliffs only, because a linear stream has a rate rather than an amount and the two cannot be added together. Continuous vesting is already visible as the slope of the curve above.",
    example:
      "Monad's 24 November 2026 event is both: a 17.1B token cliff to the team and investors, and the start of a 104M-per-week linear stream.",
  },

  capComparison: {
    title: "Price at another chain's market cap",
    short:
      "What one chain's token would cost if its valuation matched another chain's, holding its supply fixed.",
    long: "A way of putting two chains on the same scale. If a chain is priced at a tenth of another's market cap, then matching that valuation would mean a ten-times price — which is arithmetic, not a forecast.\n\nIt says nothing about whether either chain deserves its valuation. That question is what the rest of this screen is for: a chain can be a hundred times smaller than another and still be the expensive one on its own fundamentals.",
    formula:
      "own price × other market cap ÷ own market cap. On the fully diluted basis, both sides use fully diluted values instead.",
    example:
      "A chain worth $3B whose token trades at $0.80, measured against a $300B chain, gives 100× and $80 — before asking whether $300B was ever a sensible valuation.",
  },

  capBasis: {
    title: "Circulating or fully diluted",
    short:
      "Whether a comparison uses the tokens in circulation today, or every token that will exist.",
    long: 'Circulating market cap is price × the tokens in circulation today: what you can actually buy, and the basis the model ships with. Fully diluted is price × every token that will exist.\n\nThe ranking can be switched between them. On the fully diluted basis the whole screen is scored again — all six valuation ratios, the rank gap, the peer trend line and the tier — so it is a second reading of the same model rather than a recoloured column. The two differ most for young chains with long unlock schedules, which is exactly where circulating supply alone flatters.\n\n**Which supply counts as "every token".** Where a chain publishes a maximum supply, that is the one used. Where it does not — Ethereum, Solana, Monad and TON among them — there is no such number, and total supply stands in as the honest floor; the line above the table says how many chains fell into each case. This deliberately does not follow CoinGecko\'s own fully diluted figure, which counts total supply even for a capped token and so understates the dilution it claims to describe: measured September 2026 it put BNB Chain at $97B against $147B at its 200M cap, and Aptos at $0.74B against $1.28B.\n\nWhere a chain publishes an unlock schedule, its own page breaks the gap down by date and recipient rather than leaving it as one multiple.',

      "What the price must be multiplied by to reclaim its highest recorded level, and the market cap that level implies.",
    long: "The high itself is a fact about the past, and reaching it again is not a prediction — it is a yardstick for how much of a drawdown a chain is carrying.\n\nThe market cap at that high is an approximation, and an optimistic one. It multiplies the old price by *today's* supply, because no free source publishes the supply on the day of the high. For a chain that has been unlocking tokens ever since, the real market cap at the high was smaller than the figure shown.",

    long: 'It is a pattern match on the headline, and nothing more. No article is read: the feed is Google News RSS, which carries a title and no body, and every source in this app is free and keyless, so there is no sentiment service behind it.\n\nIt deliberately does not say "bullish" or "bearish". That version was built and measured against 1,842 headlines: it labelled far more of them, and got the direction wrong about a quarter of the time in ways that looked confident — "Bitcoin climbs despite equity weakness" read as bearish, and "no user funds lost" read as bullish. A headline reliably says what happened and unreliably says what it means for the price, so the badge names the event and leaves the conclusion to you.\n\nAbout a quarter of headlines carry one. The rest say nothing unambiguous enough — anything holding two directions at once is left alone rather than guessed at.',

Follower counts sit behind a paid API, and the free tiers that once carried sentiment have closed, so this uses liquidity and drawdown instead — both of which are harder to fake than a follower count.\n\nNeither feeds the score. Trading volume measures interest without saying whether the interest is informed, and distance from a high is a fact about the past.",

    short:
      "Cross-chain transfers into and out of the chain right now, from a recent sample of Mayan swaps.",
    long: "Counts, not dollars. Mayan's public feed attaches unreliable prices to individual swaps, often quoting the wrong asset, so a dollar figure per chain would be a transfer count wearing a dollar sign.\n\nThis is shown alongside the model rather than inside it.
