/**
 * What kind of news a headline is, from the headline alone.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a bullish/bearish score
 *
 * The obvious version was built first and measured against all 1,842 live
 * headlines: score the bullish words minus the bearish ones. It labelled 43% of
 * them, and a hand check of 28 put bullish at ~80% and **bearish at ~57%** — and
 * its mistakes were the confident kind. `Airdropping` matched `drop`. "Bitcoin
 * climbs *despite* equity weakness" came out bearish. "Ripple CTO *Drops*
 * Satoshi Bombshell" came out bearish. "BTC slides as BNB *bucks* the selloff"
 * came out bearish and was tagged to BNB, for which it was good news.
 *
 * Restricting the patterns to the ones that label themselves — an explicit
 * percentage move, a named incident, an unambiguous event verb — and refusing
 * anything that holds two directions at once, took coverage down to 24% and
 * accuracy up to roughly 87%/72%. The split in those numbers is the finding:
 * **a headline reliably says what happened and unreliably says what it means for
 * the price.** So this returns the event, and the interface tints it rather than
 * claiming to know where the price goes.
 *
 * There is no alternative to doing it here. CryptoPanic answers 403 without a
 * key and CoinGecko's news is Pro-only (measured 12 September 2026), Google News
 * RSS carries no article body, and every source in this app is free and keyless.
 *
 * ## Rules that keep the precision
 *
 * Every pattern is word-bounded. The unbounded first draft is what matched
 * `drop` inside `Airdropping`.
 *
 * Negation is never flipped, only refused. An earlier version inverted the score
 * when it saw a negation, which is what turned "no user funds lost" into a
 * *bullish* label on a story about an attack. A headline carrying a contrast
 * word is left unlabelled instead.
