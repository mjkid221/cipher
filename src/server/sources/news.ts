 * What counts as a headline naming a chain.
 *
 * A search for a chain returns whatever Google thinks is relevant, and for any
 * chain whose name is an ordinary English word that is mostly not the chain.
 * Measured 12 September 2026 across 1,989 headline-chain pairs, 488 never named
 * the chain at all, and for some the feed was almost entirely noise: Abstract
 * 45 of 46, Provenance 17 of 19, Linea 18 of 23, BOB 30 of 39. Abstract's were
 * about XRP, Kalshi and the Fed; Berachain's three were "Top Blockchain
 * Airdrops — Page 11" and a Greenlane earnings report.
 *
 * So a result is kept only when its title names the chain. Most chains need no
 * entry here — their own name plus their symbol is enough. These are the ones
 * where the bare name is a word English already uses, or where the project is
 * known by something else.
 *
 * Adjacency is deliberately not encoded. Linea's feed is full of MetaMask and
 * Consensys stories, and Consensys is Linea's parent, but those articles are
 * about Consensys.
