/**
 * The screen's configuration — filters, sort and valuation basis — kept across
 * refreshes.
 *
 * A zustand store with the `persist` middleware, in localStorage under
 * `par.filters`. Two decisions worth stating:
 *
 * **The search box is not persisted.** Presets, the layer, the toggles are
 * settings — a reader who screens for deep value wants that back tomorrow.
 * Typed text is a gesture; restoring "mon" into the search box on the next
 * visit would hide most of the table for no reason the reader remembers.
 *
 * **Rehydration is deferred to after mount.** The page is server-rendered with
 * the defaults; if the store read localStorage while the first client render
 * ran, the two would disagree and React would report a hydration mismatch. So
 * `skipHydration` is on and `Screen` calls `rehydrate()` in an effect — one
 * frame of defaults, then the saved filters.
 *
 * Persisted values are checked against the presets and layers that exist now,
 * so a preset renamed in a later release falls back to the default instead of
 * matching nothing.
